I prefer natural spaces to 'created' formal ones, and luckily, that's what we have most of near me. For me it is more about being able to see it, move through it and being surrounded by it rather than necessarily beng able to physically step onto it. Although the latter is important with regard to certain spaces, such as The Helm. Natural space helps to retain the 'feel' of living in a rural environment, filled with aspects of the natural enviroment all around - that is much better for people's sense of belonging, sense of well-being etc than if that space wasn't there/was lost to deveopment and, in the case of certain spaces, if they became inaccessible..",strongly_connected,not_changing,"Where I live there is a strong sense of community.

As a result, they will not witness the real joy of simply being in nature, even if some of it is left, because they are too busy snapping selfies of it for social media without realising it's true value.","I hope that someone with the power to make a change will realise that simply building more and more houses on our green spaces/countryside is not the answer to any problem, and will simply create more and is not sustainable. I hope that people will start to realise the intrinsic value of open space and the wider the natural environment, and it's value to and connection with humans and that as a result we will stop destrying it and over-managing it and trying to shape it for our benefit and convenience over its intrinsic benefits. I don't think you can really disengage open spaces from the wider natural environment becasue the reasons open space is valuable are the same as why the wider natural environment is valuable - they provide ecosystem services from clean air to flood risk management, from well-being to education, from habitat to food.","Lots of places!

",neither_strong_nor_weak,not_changing,,other,N/A,i_have_never_been_,,I feel as though technology has deprived younger generations of the desire to explore the world. Growing up I would play every day in my backyard and my family would often take trips into the mountains or go camping or just on small hikes. We would also go to parks fairly often. My friends had a farm that we would frequent as well. This is something that I don't think kids today experience mainly because of the focus on technology and being where the action is rather than going to countryside or finding enjoyment in our backyards/parks. From a young age we are training the younger generation to look more to technology for amusement rather than going outside because all of the entertainment can be done inside on a device. I fear that they will not get to witness the national parks or countryside in the same way that me and my generation did. It was a part of my upbringing and it no longer seems to be that way for present day children. ,"My hopes for the future is to see people take more notice of the world around us. Whether that be the nature, the seasons, the natural disasters, the parks, etc. anything to get our focus off of our phones or our school/work life. There is so much to experience and I wish that our world wasn't so quick to pick up a phone or to turn on the TV. I know its such a cliche thing to say in this day and age, but truly even the most self aware people can ignore the bad habit of being on a phone or other technological device. 

There is also a ridiculous need to have more infrastructure or to get bigger and better. This requires taking out nature from our lives, as we need to have somewhere to put the buildings. If only more people were intently focused on getting bigger and better green spaces. There wouldn't be as much focus on what we are lacking, but rather what we already naturally have on the earth. It was put here for a reason, why take it away? ","I don't really have a place that makes me happy. I guess my home could be a place where I am happy. But its not so much the building, or the location, or the people. For me its circumstance or occasion that determines what makes me happy. For example - going out to eat to celebrate.

I believe it was a bad decision to give the National Park UNESCO status. To me it was the wrong kind of protection. Obviously there needs to be protection for both its natural and man made landscapes, heritage and culture. The campaign to get UNESCO protection placed far too much emphasis on encouraging more visitors of which there is already over 18 million annually. This is not sustainable and it can already be seen in the summer gridlocks. There also needs to be more access to village properties for local people. Turning these communities into ghost villages in the winter months with the onslaught of second homes again is not sustainable and threatens to create a cultural desert. ","Without greater support for both farming communities, the natural British landscape and a sustained environment recovery, we are in danger of losing both a unique way of life for people and wildlife. One of the biggest blows was leaving Europe. It was not about whether or not we could manage our own landscapes and culture. It should have been about creating more collaboration with countries across Europe. I don't think the farming communities really understood what this means for them and their way of life in the future. Becoming isolated is not the answer and I believe we in the UK will pay dearly for this decision, especially in rural communities and environmental protection",I hope that we can strike a balance of sustainability for the countryside and what it means to so many people whether they live and work there or make frequent or infrequent visits. Its been heartening to see a number of art and local community projects which have encouraged people to look again at where they are and what it would mean to them and others if we lose the ability to go to these places. ,"On a mountain top, wild swimming",,info@paulharrisphotography.com,Paul,Eskdale,"Like most mountain landscape, the Lake District is best experienced early in the morning or late in the day when fewer people are around and when the weather allows you the opportunity to feel alive.

I have repeated this many times now and it remains a very special place from the track over the packhorse bridge in Eskdale to wandering over the Great Moss. A ridge circuit of Great Langdale was another highlight one gloriously cold and sunny day in winter, starting below Stickle Tarn, over Pike O'Stickle, Gimmer, Bowfell, Crinkle Crags and down the verglassed steps of Pike of Blisco in the gathering dusk. and finally I had been part of a fund raising team for the Red cross doing a mountain marathon walk camped below Red Pike.

It's also on the edge of the Lake District National Park. I love being in nature, and think it is really important for people's mental health and to learn and understand our natural world. But the current access to it is very restricted to just the public footpaths and car parks. It's not acceptable to walk across or for children to play on unused farmland, as England doesn't have the same public access rights as in Scotland. I think this is very restrictive. I would like large areas  of grazing land rewilded and for the public to be able to have access to it. ",neither_strong_nor_weak,not_changing,"I have always moved around a lot, so do not have a particularly strong connection to anywhere that I live.

",its_ok,Nature / The LDNPA,choice_7,"I think there are two main challenges. Brexit will mean more people will have Staycations in Britain. However, as has been seen here since lockdown was eased, many people who may travel to The Lakes don't respect rural areas or understand the link between their own attitudes and behaviour and the bigger issue of climate change. I think there needs to be a mass public countryside education programme with a co-ordinated approach between all the national parks. I think rewilding and diversification of the landscape will help with this so that there is more for people to learn about. The other challenge, which could be in conflict with this, is that Britain will have to produce more of our own food and farmers will not receive EU grants to set aside land. A lot of what is now unused or minimally used land in The Lakes will have to be turned over for growing food. I think that could be an improvement to have food production and wilder nature side by side, but The Lakes will look different.

I love the wide variety of the landscape and the 'old-fashioned' feel of it, as it makes me feel safe and is also a healing environment to help rinse off the troubles of modern day life - often literally, given the amount of rain!. But, I also feel sad that there is so much potential to improve upon the area to make it a great example of how new ideas can contribute to reducing climate change, but they are not being allowed by the LDNPA. ","Staying in a cottage at Seldom Seen near Ullswater was a really enriching experience. To be in the middle of broadleaf woodland with wildlife like birds, insects, squirrels and badgers so close around the cottage felt magical. It was Spring when I stayed there and the wildflowers were incredible. At the time I lived in a rural area of Scotland, which is also nice, but I had never experienced anything so lush and varied there. ","The LDNPA as it is now because its policies are too restrictive towards people who live here and have to work for a living. It behaves like a custodian of a giant museum and playground for wealthy people with a direct link back to the days when Wordsworth opposed a rail service into The Lakes to keep poor day trippers away! It needs to be replaced with a go-ahead administrative body that will welcome people to live, work and holiday here from all backgrounds and allow the creation of an environment that can be a model for future environmental learning of all kinds, including landscape, activities, Arts and culture, business and housing.

Covid-19 will have a massive impact on funding for local initiatives to support those with less access to  the outdoors. I believe strongly that it is in our schools with young children that we need to focus our efforts in getting them to love  nature and champion it over evermore development which threatens every single one of our open spaces.I was involved with DofE training when I was working and feel that this is the ideal way to get kids outdoors, along with forest schools. It would be great to have a DofE type award for younger kids. ",i_love_it,lonely fells and ridges where I may be able to find silence and solitude. ,i_am_a_regular_visitor,"I worry about the effects of pollution and crowded roads - if there could be a system of electric minibuses connecting the main hubs so people could leave their cars on the periphery rather than jam up all the villages, that might help,especially for those who don't want to hike,who just want to drive around and look.       
I absolutely don't think it is an appropriate place for further developments for thrill seekers - there are enough ziplines, go ape etc. It should be kept as it is. However I don't agree that the hill farmers should allow their sheep on the high fells just because it's a tradition; with climate change these high rocky tops need to be managed differently, perhaps with trees as a crop, and the sheep should remain in lower valleys. I agree with George Monbiot that the Lake District is sheep-wrecked, and not with James Rebanks who thinks things should never change.    ","Birds of prey, hares, rabbits, woodland. Time to stand and stare. To disconnect from the imperative of capitalism and to simply be in a place.","More protection from the NPA to allow natural processes to evolve, and to reduce development. The various bodies representing locals and visitors alike need to collaborate more and not give in to vested interests, Land ownership needs to change - Lord whatshisname who tried to sell Blencathra and the National Trust need to do more to 'wild' their lands. ","Walking on my own, somewhere on a fellside with wild weather ahead of me and knowledge that a warm dry bed awaits on the other side, where I will wake to the sound of a rushing beck with birdsong nearby. ",,watonsue@gmail.com,Sue Waton,Black Sail Hut -I go every year (except this one).,"Peaceful, connected to the universe, whole, well, content. Vitally alive,with a physical fizz of joy in my veins as I see the familiar outlines of the fells I love. I fiercely want to keep it empty of cars and people who don't appreciate that connection! As I drive north my heart sings and once I am in amongst the fells and valleys I want to stay forever; I want to get to know each fell in all weathers and seasons, and immerse myself in the play of light, the cloud shadows, and just to simply 'be' in the place. It is my place of strength; when I had cancer; two major operations, chemo and was told I had a 20% chance of recovery, it was where I visualised myself getting stronger. I had a photo of a little hidden grass 'beach' beside Black Sail Beck where I would sit and commune with the birds and that was where I went to in my head during treatment and recovery. I am now 4 years clear.  ","On the C2C, my pal Tricia and I headed down to Haweswater via High and Low Raise, instead of the traditional route, along with 4 others we'd met along the way; we all reached the footbridge over Measand Beck and lay back in the grass in complete silence. It was then that I had the most powerful sensation of connecting to the universe - every blade of grass, every breath of breeze, every swish of bird feathers and every atom of air. it was a deeply shared connection, I can remember the sensation of the ground under my back, the warmth of the sun and the perfect stillness to this day.   I still meet up with one of those walkers to share moments in the wild fastness of Scotland, where we need no words, we walk and know we both feel the same about these places. ","Wilding, as in Ennerdale. It is better for flood management which will be more important as our weather patterns change,more trees will help mitigate climate change and the higher land cannot be used for anything else really. I live near Knepp and know well the benefits of wilding. Also Carrifran in the Borders. All fab examples of how a naturalised landscape is better for everyone.",,,,,,,,-0.37296,50.83212

For much of my local community, the green spaces provide their livelihood, as it does mine - albeit in a different way. I live amongst farmers, and people who have chosen to find this isolated village as a haven (with good broadband in many cases). We can be apart but connected and we can use the gift of space but keep in touch. 
Practically, it is somewhere I can keep my horses, stay near my sister and afford to live. I ""use"" the space to simply ""be"" in, to retreat to, to tend and to feel grounded in - watching seasons change and the natural world (from which I don't feel a separate part).
I use it to stimulate my art and to learn from.",strongly_connected,getting_stronger," It is somewhere that I feel connected to a part of what makes me, me. Much as I love the vibe, excitement, novelty and quantity of offer in a city - I don't feel connected to them. Returning to, waking upon, and simply existing in the wide green open space here is like being in one's own skin. I don't feel separate from the land - and I think our relationship goes much deeper than biophilia, enjoyment, physical fitness and even well-being. I feel that we are all part of the same - we breathe the same air, the same water runs through our bodies; the earth is made up of parts of us and we come from the earth.
Our small community here has weathered several crises - and the first thing that happens is always swift local help set-up - no matter one's opinions of one's neighbour - in times of difficulty, we all help each other.

The chance to share your breath with the mountain.
The chance to sit and listen to a tumbling stream.
The chance to take part in slow time.
The chance to witness natural world (of which we are part!) happening.","I hope that more people will be able to access them, that swathes of private land become available for more people to experience, and that people will be able to get to them easily (transport links).
And then I hope that more people will understand the importance of our landscape, how we humans have shaped it and how we must protect and nurture it - it is after all - our bedrock, our bed and our cradle, our resting ground.
I hope that people will be able to connect with each other - recognising that our land is our connection - wherever it is in the world.
I hope that green and open spaces will be valued and protected - transport links need to be green; they mustn't be ridden roughshod over in the drive for money and speed. (HS2 - utterly pointless with irreplaceable damage potentially being done).
I hope that those who make decisions in the future will take the long view - not the short, money-for-mates view. Protecting such green and open spaces should be top of the agenda.","The little plateaus of Silver Howe.

Because it was important to have the answers, true, and because I didn't know what those answers were.
