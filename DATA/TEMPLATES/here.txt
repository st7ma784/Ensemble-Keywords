in a piece of evening
the year radiates from a tree
while the air, quickening,
finds my throat
and feels like snow
I breathe what might have been
hear the river the only way I can
the ridge’s shadow cuts a dark line
folds a single moment above moss
and glaciers’ signatures,
ribboned streams, blistered rocks
my senses keen to the wind
and in its passage everything is changing
Coniston Old Man, Swirl How,
Easedale, Harrison Stickle, clouds
water plaits its way down the valley
hides itself in bog and and mirrors
the revolutions of ravens
are we lost?
questions present themselves
flow over bright green weeds
like children choosing between damage

and the sunny side
land beneath us, sky above
I hang my thoughts as silhouettes
behind the sun
and wait
