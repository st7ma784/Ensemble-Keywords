here we tread, navigating the rhyming forms of hills
the scribbling of becks, their busy tongues speaking the shape of rocks
our track is a contoured calligraphy of trees, rivers, fells
with the punctuation of birds, frogs, clouds
as we walk through stanzas of flowers,
we are enclosed by wind, a parenthesis
between rains
