this small skin-held society, my body,
feels its way
over grass and stone
leans into wind

an ecology
of muscles, sinews, joints
eyes, feet
knees find their own consciousness
pain rises, then eases

like a river after rain

day by day
body takes over mind
shows what it knows
learns as it goes

when weariness sets in the mind compels
those final, necessary movements
to fix up home, to make food
to eat
then, lying flat, the body lets go

muscle by muscle
tendon and nerve

relaxes into healing
and over time, like land weathered
the body finds its strongest form
to be upright, and certain

in the face of a storm
